  It's currently not possible to comment out trees of tags. This sucks. Fixing
  this will require the grammar to be rethought a bit, as it'll need a rule like:

  rule =
  [etc]
  COMMENT rule
  [etc]
  .

  which won't currently work at all. 'rule' gets followed in order to match
  the line, which means that process_*_rule gets called before the line is matched,
  and is added to the AST before the code for the line fires.

  In summary: you don't find out that the rule is commented until it's too late
  to do anything about it.

  The work-around is to comment out the line before the tree, as shown below.
